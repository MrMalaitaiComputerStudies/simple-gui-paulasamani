# The purpose of this is to demonstrate the ability to create a simple GUI, commit, and then push it so that Mr Malaitai can read it.

# The GUI is to have the following:
# 1 Label widget that says "Enter name"
# 1 Entry widget next to the Label widget
# 1 Button widget that spans over 2 columns underneath the Label and Entry widgets.
import tkinter as tk


root = tk.Tk()






root.mainloop()
